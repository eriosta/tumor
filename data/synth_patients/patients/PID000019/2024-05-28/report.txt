Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. side-branch IPMN (no worrisome features). no pancreatic mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: 65 mm spiculated enhancing renal mass in the left kidney, lower pole. No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
