Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. pancreas is normal.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. no adrenal nodule.
Kidneys: 70 mm spiculated enhancing renal mass in the left kidney, lower pole. No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. kidneys are normal.
