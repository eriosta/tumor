IMPRESSION:
- Pancreas primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at tail of the pancreas measuring approximately 79 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 79 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T2: Lymph node — 23 mm (short axis) at baseline.
- SLD baseline: 102 mm.
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: Baseline (no category).

Comment: Some features are diagnostic of; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
