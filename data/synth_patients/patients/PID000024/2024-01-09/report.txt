FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-11-20.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. subpleural reticulation.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 1.2 cm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: 107 mm spiculated pancreatic mass in the tail of the pancreas (isoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. side-branch IPMN (no worrisome features). no pancreatic mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. no adrenal nodule.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
