FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-05-09.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. no pulmonary abnormality.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 12 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. spleen normal size.
Pancreas: 4.8 cm spiculated pancreatic mass in the tail of the pancreas (isoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. side-branch IPMN (no worrisome features).
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. no colonic mass.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. simple physiologic cyst.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged celiac lymph node, short axis 14 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. degenerative changes.

IMPRESSION:
