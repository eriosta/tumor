FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. no pleural nodularity.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. no hepatic mass.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. pancreas is normal.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 34 mm lobulated gastric mass at the antrum of the stomach (hypoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking. no peritoneal nodularity.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. under-distension wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged internal iliac lymph node, short axis 21 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: Sclerotic osseous metastasis—nonmeasurable by RECIST (blastic). No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Stomach primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at antrum of the stomach measuring approximately 34 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 34 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T2: Metastasis — 12 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T3: Lymph node — 21 mm (short axis) at baseline.
- SLD baseline: 67 mm.
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: Baseline (no category).

Comment: Some features are less likely; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
