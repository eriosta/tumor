FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Comparison: 2023-08-07.
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. prominent but subthreshold lymph nodes. no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. trace effusion.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. mild aortic atherosclerosis.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 2.3 cm lobulated gastric mass at the antrum of the stomach (hypoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking. no peritoneal nodularity.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged internal iliac lymph node, short axis 1.5 cm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: Sclerotic osseous metastasis—nonmeasurable by RECIST (blastic). No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Stomach primary malignancy at antrum of the stomach measuring approximately 23 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 34→23 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 12→8 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 21→15 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 67 mm.
- SLD current: 46 mm (-31.3% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
