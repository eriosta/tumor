FINDINGS:
Partial volume averaging may obscure small foci.
Comparison: 2023-09-20.
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax. bronchial wall thickening. no pleural effusion. Post-treatment change: fat stranding.
Mediastinum: Enlarged right hilar lymph node, short axis 9 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 4.9 cm spiculated hepatic mass in segment 4 of the liver (hypoenhancing). No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. no hepatic mass.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
