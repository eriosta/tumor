FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Comparison: 2024-04-24.
Pulmonary parenchyma: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged right hilar lymph node, short axis 0.9 cm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. no pleural nodularity.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. tortuosity. no aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 73 mm spiculated hepatic mass in segment 4 of the liver (hypoenhancing). No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. adrenal glands normal.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. small benign polyp.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged porta hepatis lymph node, short axis 14 mm with central necrosis. Enlarged external iliac lymph node, short axis 32 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
