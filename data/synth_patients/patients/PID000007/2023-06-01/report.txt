FINDINGS:
Partial volume averaging may obscure small foci.
Comparison: 2023-04-05.
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 18 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 39 mm lobulated hepatic mass in segment 7 of the liver (hyperenhancing). No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. Post-ablation/embolization change: non-enhancing ablation zone with peripheral halo; contraction over time.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. pancreas is normal.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. no renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. small benign polyp. stomach is normal.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: Sclerotic osseous metastasis—nonmeasurable by RECIST (blastic). No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. bone islands.

IMPRESSION:

  • T3: Lymph node — 29→18 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 118 mm.
- SLD current: 75 mm (-36.4% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
