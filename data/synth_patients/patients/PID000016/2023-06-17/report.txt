FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Comparison: 2023-04-22.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. dependent atelectasis.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. small thymic remnant. no mediastinal mass.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 43 mm lobulated hepatic mass in segment 3 of the liver (hypoenhancing). No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. simple cyst (<2 cm). no pancreatic mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. no bowel obstruction.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged porta hepatis lymph node, short axis 1.7 cm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Liver primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at segment 3 of the liver measuring approximately 43 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 65→43 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 24→17 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 89 mm.
- SLD current: 60 mm (-32.6% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.

Comment: Some features are most likely; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
