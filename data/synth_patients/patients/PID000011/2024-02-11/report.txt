FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Comparison: 2023-12-06.
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. no pleural nodularity.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 23 mm spiculated hepatic mass in segment 2 of the liver (hyperenhancing). No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. no pancreatic mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. no adrenal nodule.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. small benign polyp.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking. no peritoneal nodularity.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged mesenteric lymph node, short axis 8 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
