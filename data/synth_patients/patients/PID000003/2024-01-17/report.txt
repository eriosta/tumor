FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-11-22.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. Post-treatment change: ground-glass opacities within field.
Mediastinum: Enlarged right hilar lymph node, short axis 9 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. no pleural nodularity.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 37 mm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. no hepatic mass.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. Bosniak I cyst.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: 3.6 cm smooth mass within the prostate gland, peripheral zone. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. prostate is normal / no prostatic mass.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node, short axis 2.4 cm. Enlarged inguinal lymph node, short axis 3.3 cm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
