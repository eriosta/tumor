FINDINGS:
Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
Comparison: 2023-08-19.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. Post-treatment change: consolidation conforming to beam path.
Mediastinum: Enlarged right hilar lymph node, short axis 9 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. no pleural nodularity.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 1.9 cm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. serous cystadenoma.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. no adrenal nodule.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. angiomyolipoma (macroscopic fat).
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: 17 mm smooth mass within the prostate gland, peripheral zone. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node, short axis 1.2 cm. Enlarged inguinal lymph node, short axis 17 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Prostate primary malignancy at prostate gland, peripheral zone measuring approximately 17 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: liver.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:

  • T3: Lymph node — 19→12 mm (short axis).
  • T4: Lymph node — 26→17 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 101 mm.
- SLD current: 65 mm (-35.6% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
