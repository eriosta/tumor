FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-08-21.
Pulmonary parenchyma: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 21 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. no hepatic mass.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: 39 mm lobulated pancreatic mass in the tail of the pancreas (hypoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. pancreas is normal.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. angiomyolipoma (macroscopic fat).
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. no colonic mass.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: Sclerotic osseous metastasis—nonmeasurable by RECIST (blastic). No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Pancreas primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at tail of the pancreas measuring approximately 39 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 38→39 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 35→33 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 22→21 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 95 mm.
- SLD current: 93 mm (-2.1% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.

Comment: Some features are diagnostic of; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
