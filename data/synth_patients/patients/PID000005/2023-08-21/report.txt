FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-06-22.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. subpleural reticulation. lungs are normal.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 15 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. prominent but subthreshold lymph nodes.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: 26 mm lobulated pancreatic mass in the tail of the pancreas (hypoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. adrenal glands normal.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. no renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: Sclerotic osseous metastasis—nonmeasurable by RECIST (blastic). No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. degenerative changes. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Pancreas primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at tail of the pancreas measuring approximately 26 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 38→26 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 35→25 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 22→15 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 95 mm.
- SLD current: 66 mm (-30.5% change).
- New lesions: present (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.

Comment: Some features are probable; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
