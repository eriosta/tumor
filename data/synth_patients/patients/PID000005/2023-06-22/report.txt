FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. no pleural effusion. Post-treatment change: consolidation conforming to beam path.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 22 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. mild aortic atherosclerosis.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. simple cyst. liver is normal.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: 3.8 cm lobulated pancreatic mass in the tail of the pancreas (hypoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. small benign polyp.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. prostate is normal / no prostatic mass.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: Sclerotic osseous metastasis—nonmeasurable by RECIST (blastic). No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Pancreas primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at tail of the pancreas measuring approximately 38 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 38 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T2: Metastasis — 35 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T3: Lymph node — 22 mm (short axis) at baseline.
- SLD baseline: 95 mm.
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: Baseline (no category).

Comment: Some features are indeterminate for; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
