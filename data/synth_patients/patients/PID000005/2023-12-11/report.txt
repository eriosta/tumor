FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-10-16.
Pulmonary parenchyma: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 2.8 cm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no mediastinal mass.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. no pleural nodularity.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. no aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: 4.9 cm lobulated pancreatic mass in the tail of the pancreas (hypoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. side-branch IPMN (no worrisome features).
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. no adrenal nodule.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. Bosniak I cyst.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: 42 mm lesion in the bone, suspicious for metastasis. No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:

  • T3: Lymph node — 22→28 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 95 mm.
- SLD current: 119 mm (+25.3% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.
