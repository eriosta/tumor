FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Comparison: 2023-03-06.
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax. Post-treatment change: ground-glass opacities within field.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 1.0 cm with central necrosis. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 35 mm irregular hepatic mass in segment 2 of the liver (isoenhancing). No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. no pancreatic mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. kidneys are normal.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. nonspecific fluid levels.
Mesentery/Omentum: 6 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged internal iliac lymph node, short axis 13 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: 16 mm lesion in the bone, suspicious for metastasis. No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Liver primary malignancy at segment 2 of the liver measuring approximately 35 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=4; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 54→35 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 25→16 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 10→6 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 20→13 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 109 mm.
- SLD current: 70 mm (-35.8% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
