FINDINGS:
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 10 mm with central necrosis. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 54 mm irregular hepatic mass in segment 2 of the liver (isoenhancing). No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. liver is normal.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. no pancreatic mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. adrenal glands normal.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. nonspecific fluid levels.
Mesentery/Omentum: 1.0 cm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. urinary bladder normal.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged internal iliac lymph node, short axis 2.0 cm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: 2.5 cm lesion in the bone, suspicious for metastasis. No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. bone islands. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Liver primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at segment 2 of the liver measuring approximately 54 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=4; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 54 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T2: Metastasis — 25 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T3: Metastasis — 10 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T4: Lymph node — 20 mm (short axis) at baseline.
- SLD baseline: 109 mm.
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: Baseline (no category).

Comment: Some features are virtually diagnostic of; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
