FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-05-09.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. mild bronchiectasis. Post-treatment change: traction bronchiectasis.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. small thymic remnant. no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. no pleural nodularity.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. no aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. hemangioma (peripheral nodular enhancement with centripetal fill-in). liver is normal.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: 3.7 cm lobulated pancreatic mass in the neck of the pancreas (isoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. Postsurgical change: altered anatomy post-resection.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. lipid-rich adenoma.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. stomach is normal.
Mesentery/Omentum: 30 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. prostate is normal / no prostatic mass.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged mesenteric lymph node, short axis 1.9 cm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Pancreas primary malignancy at neck of the pancreas measuring approximately 37 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: lung, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:

  • T1: Primary — 34→37 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 29→30 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 18→19 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 81 mm.
- SLD current: 86 mm (+6.2% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
