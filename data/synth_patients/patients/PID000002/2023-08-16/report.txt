FINDINGS:
Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
Comparison: 2023-06-28.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. no pleural effusion.
Mediastinum: Enlarged subcarinal lymph node, short axis 18 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. no hepatic mass.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. no pancreatic mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. no renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 33 mm smooth gastric mass at the lesser curvature of the stomach (isoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. small benign polyp. stomach is normal.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. BPH.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Stomach primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at lesser curvature of the stomach measuring approximately 33 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 38→33 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 20→18 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 58 mm.
- SLD current: 51 mm (-12.1% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.

Comment: Some features are classic for; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
