FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax. bronchial wall thickening. calcified granuloma. no suspicious pulmonary nodule.
Mediastinum: Enlarged subcarinal lymph node, short axis 2.0 cm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. aorta normal caliber.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. accessory spleen.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 38 mm smooth gastric mass at the lesser curvature of the stomach (isoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. urinary bladder normal.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.

IMPRESSION:
- Stomach primary malignancy at lesser curvature of the stomach measuring approximately 38 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 38 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T2: Lymph node — 20 mm (short axis) at baseline.
- SLD baseline: 58 mm.
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: Baseline (no category).
