IMPRESSION:
- Stomach primary malignancy at lesser curvature of the stomach measuring approximately 42 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 38→42 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 20→23 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 58 mm.
- SLD current: 65 mm (+12.1% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.
