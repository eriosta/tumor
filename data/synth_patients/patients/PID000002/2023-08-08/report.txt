EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT CAP with portal venous phase abdomen/pelvis; chest imaged in a single post-contrast phase.
HISTORY: Staging/restaging of solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged subcarinal lymph node, short axis 17 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: 6.4 cm smooth mass within the prostate gland, peripheral zone. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
INCIDENTAL / OTHER FINDINGS:
- gi.colon: diverticulosis
- aorta_great_vessels: mild aortic atherosclerosis
- bones: degenerative changes
- pleura: trace effusion

NEGATIVE FINDINGS:
- bladder: no focal bladder wall thickening
- kidneys: kidneys are normal
- lung: no suspicious pulmonary nodule
- pancreas: pancreas is normal
- bones: no destructive osseous lesion
- mesentery_peritoneum: no peritoneal nodularity
- mediastinum: no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy

IMPRESSION:
- Prostate primary malignancy at prostate gland, peripheral zone measuring approximately 64 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 64 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T2: Lymph node — 17 mm (short axis) at baseline.
- SLD baseline: 81 mm.
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: Baseline (no category).
