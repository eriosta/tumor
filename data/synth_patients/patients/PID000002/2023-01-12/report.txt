FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Pulmonary parenchyma: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. no pleural nodularity.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. tiny cyst. spleen normal size.
Pancreas: 34 mm lobulated pancreatic mass in the neck of the pancreas (isoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. side-branch IPMN (no worrisome features). no pancreatic mass. Postsurgical change: altered anatomy post-resection.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. adrenal glands normal.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. stomach is normal.
Mesentery/Omentum: 29 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. BPH.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged mesenteric lymph node, short axis 18 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Pancreas primary malignancy at neck of the pancreas measuring approximately 34 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: lung, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 34 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T2: Metastasis — 29 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T3: Lymph node — 18 mm (short axis) at baseline.
- SLD baseline: 81 mm.
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: Baseline (no category).
