FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Comparison: 2023-01-12.
Pulmonary parenchyma: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. small thymic remnant. prominent but subthreshold lymph nodes.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: 38 mm lobulated pancreatic mass in the neck of the pancreas (isoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. pancreas is normal.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. lipid-rich adenoma.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. no renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. no colonic mass.
Mesentery/Omentum: 30 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged mesenteric lymph node, short axis 20 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Pancreas primary malignancy at neck of the pancreas measuring approximately 38 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: lung, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 34→38 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 29→30 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 18→20 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 81 mm.
- SLD current: 88 mm (+8.6% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
