FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Comparison: 2023-03-24.
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax. Post-treatment change: consolidation conforming to beam path.
Mediastinum: Enlarged subcarinal lymph node, short axis 13 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. small thymic remnant.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. no aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. liver is normal.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. serous cystadenoma.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 26 mm smooth gastric mass at the lesser curvature of the stomach (isoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Stomach primary malignancy at lesser curvature of the stomach measuring approximately 26 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 38→26 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 20→13 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 58 mm.
- SLD current: 39 mm (-32.8% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
