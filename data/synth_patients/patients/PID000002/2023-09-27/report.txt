EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous <=5-mm axial images. Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
HISTORY: Staging/restaging of solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Pulmonary parenchyma: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged subcarinal lymph node, short axis 19 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: 6.7 cm smooth mass within the prostate gland, peripheral zone. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 2023-08-08, interval evaluation as below.
POST-TREATMENT / PROCEDURAL CHANGES:
- Radiation change: traction bronchiectasis

INCIDENTAL / OTHER FINDINGS:
- mediastinum: prominent but subthreshold lymph nodes
- lung: bronchial wall thickening
- bladder: under-distension wall thickening
- gi.small_bowel: nonspecific fluid levels

NEGATIVE FINDINGS:
- gi: no colonic mass
- spleen: spleen normal size
- mediastinum: no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy
- kidneys: no renal mass
- reproductive: prostate is normal / no prostatic mass
- lung: no pulmonary abnormality
- pancreas: no pancreatic mass

IMPRESSION:
- Prostate primary malignancy at prostate gland, peripheral zone measuring approximately 67 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 64→67 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 17→19 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 81 mm.
- SLD current: 86 mm (+6.2% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
