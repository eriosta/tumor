FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-03-04.
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax. Post-treatment change: ground-glass opacities within field. Post-treatment change: stricture formation.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. no hepatic mass.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. accessory spleen. spleen normal size.
Pancreas: 31 mm lobulated pancreatic mass in the neck of the pancreas (isoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. no pancreatic mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. lipid-rich adenoma. adrenal glands normal.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. kidneys are normal.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. physiologic under-distension thickening. no bowel obstruction.
Mesentery/Omentum: 26 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking. no peritoneal nodularity.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. under-distension wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. simple physiologic cyst.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged mesenteric lymph node, short axis 16 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:

  • T2: Metastasis — 29→26 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 18→16 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 81 mm.
- SLD current: 73 mm (-9.9% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
