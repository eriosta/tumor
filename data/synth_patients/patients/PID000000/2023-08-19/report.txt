EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT CAP with portal venous phase abdomen/pelvis; chest imaged in a single post-contrast phase. Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
HISTORY: Staging/restaging of solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Enlarged right hilar lymph node, short axis 26 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 18 mm irregular mass involving the transverse colon with focal wall thickening (hyperenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged celiac lymph node, short axis 1.5 cm. Enlarged internal iliac lymph node, short axis 30 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
INCIDENTAL / OTHER FINDINGS:
- gi.small_bowel: nonspecific fluid levels
- kidneys: angiomyolipoma (macroscopic fat)
- pancreas: side-branch IPMN (no worrisome features)

NEGATIVE FINDINGS:
- pleura: no pleural nodularity
- aorta_great_vessels: no aneurysm or dissection
- spleen: no focal splenic lesion
- mediastinum: no mediastinal mass
- gi: no bowel obstruction
- pancreas: no pancreatic mass
- bladder: urinary bladder normal

IMPRESSION:
- Colon primary malignancy at transverse colon measuring approximately 18 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 18 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T2: Lymph node — 26 mm (short axis) at baseline.
  • T3: Lymph node — 15 mm (short axis) at baseline.
- SLD baseline: 59 mm.
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: Baseline (no category).
