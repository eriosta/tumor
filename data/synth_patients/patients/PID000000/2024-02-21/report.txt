FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Comparison: 2023-12-14.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. Post-treatment change: wall thickening and submucosal edema in irradiated bowel.
Mediastinum: Enlarged right hilar lymph node, short axis 2.3 cm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. no aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. accessory spleen.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. no adrenal nodule.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. no renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 16 mm irregular mass involving the transverse colon with focal wall thickening (hyperenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged celiac lymph node, short axis 13 mm. Enlarged internal iliac lymph node, short axis 30 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Colon primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at transverse colon measuring approximately 16 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 18→16 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 26→23 mm (short axis).
  • T3: Lymph node — 15→13 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 59 mm.
- SLD current: 52 mm (-11.9% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.

Comment: Some features are unlikely; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
