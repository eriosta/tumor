EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT CAP with portal venous phase abdomen/pelvis; chest imaged in a single post-contrast phase. Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
HISTORY: Staging/restaging of solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged right hilar lymph node, short axis 16 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 1.1 cm irregular mass involving the transverse colon with focal wall thickening (hyperenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged celiac lymph node, short axis 9 mm. Enlarged internal iliac lymph node, short axis 3.0 cm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 2023-08-19, interval evaluation as below.
POST-TREATMENT / PROCEDURAL CHANGES:
- Radiation change: consolidation conforming to beam path

INCIDENTAL / OTHER FINDINGS:
- bones: degenerative changes
- pleura: pleural calcifications
- pancreas: simple cyst (<2 cm)
- pleura: trace effusion
- spleen: accessory spleen

NEGATIVE FINDINGS:
- mesentery_peritoneum: no peritoneal nodularity
- kidneys: kidneys are normal
- reproductive: ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality
- liver: no hepatic mass
- bladder: urinary bladder normal
- pancreas: pancreas is normal
- bones: no destructive osseous lesion

IMPRESSION:
- Colon primary malignancy at transverse colon measuring approximately 11 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 18→11 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 26→16 mm (short axis).
  • T3: Lymph node — 15→9 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 59 mm.
- SLD current: 36 mm (-39.0% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
