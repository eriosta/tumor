FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-07-04.
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax. dependent atelectasis.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 9 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 12 mm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. liver is normal. Post-ablation/embolization change: non-enhancing ablation cavity with peripheral rim; SBRT field with altered enhancement.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: 4.7 cm smooth pancreatic mass in the body of the pancreas (hypoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. no colonic mass.
Mesentery/Omentum: 17 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. urinary bladder normal.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged celiac lymph node, short axis 19 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Pancreas primary malignancy at body of the pancreas measuring approximately 47 mm.

  • T3: Metastasis — 19→17 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 21→19 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 103 mm.
- SLD current: 95 mm (-7.8% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
