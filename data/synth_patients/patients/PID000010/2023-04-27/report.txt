FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Comparison: 2023-03-06.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. subpleural reticulation.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 9 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 1.1 cm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: 46 mm smooth pancreatic mass in the body of the pancreas (hypoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. simple cyst (<2 cm).
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. adrenal glands normal.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. stomach is normal.
Mesentery/Omentum: 1.8 cm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking. no peritoneal nodularity.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged celiac lymph node, short axis 19 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Pancreas primary malignancy at body of the pancreas measuring approximately 46 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: liver, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=4; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 50→46 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 13→11 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 19→18 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 21→19 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 103 mm.
- SLD current: 94 mm (-8.7% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
