FINDINGS:
Partial volume averaging may obscure small foci.
Comparison: 2023-01-01.
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 9 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. trace effusion.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 14 mm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. spleen normal size.
Pancreas: 55 mm smooth pancreatic mass in the body of the pancreas (hypoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. pancreas is normal.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. kidneys are normal.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. small benign polyp.
Mesentery/Omentum: 2.0 cm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged celiac lymph node, short axis 2.3 cm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:

  • T4: Lymph node — 21→23 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 103 mm.
- SLD current: 112 mm (+8.7% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
