FINDINGS:
Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. no suspicious pulmonary nodule.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. hemangioma (peripheral nodular enhancement with centripetal fill-in). no hepatic mass.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. pancreas is normal.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. adrenal glands normal.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: 3.6 cm irregular mass within the prostate gland, peripheral zone. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. simple physiologic cyst.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Prostate primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at prostate gland, peripheral zone measuring approximately 36 mm.
- No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=1; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 36 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
- SLD baseline: 36 mm.
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: Baseline (no category).

Comment: Some features are unlikely; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
