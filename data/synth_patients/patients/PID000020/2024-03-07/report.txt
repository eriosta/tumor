FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2024-01-19.
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax. bronchial wall thickening. no suspicious pulmonary nodule. Post-treatment change: wall thickening and submucosal edema in irradiated bowel.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 22 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. aorta normal caliber.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. no hepatic mass.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 68 mm lobulated gastric mass at the greater curvature of the stomach (hyperenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. no colonic mass.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Stomach primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at greater curvature of the stomach measuring approximately 68 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 52→68 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 17→22 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 69 mm.
- SLD current: 90 mm (+30.4% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.

Comment: Some features are could reflect; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
