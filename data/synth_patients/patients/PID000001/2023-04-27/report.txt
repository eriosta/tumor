EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous <=5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging/restaging of solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: 32 mm spiculated mass within the prostate gland, peripheral zone. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 2023-03-07, interval evaluation as below.
POST-TREATMENT / PROCEDURAL CHANGES:
- Postsurgical change: postoperative fluid collection

INCIDENTAL / OTHER FINDINGS:
- kidneys: angiomyolipoma (macroscopic fat)
- liver: hemangioma (peripheral nodular enhancement with centripetal fill-in)
- pancreas: simple cyst (<2 cm)

NEGATIVE FINDINGS:
- kidneys: kidneys are normal
- adrenals: adrenal glands normal
- liver: no hepatic mass
- lung: no pulmonary abnormality
- mediastinum: no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy
- pancreas: pancreas is normal
- mesentery_peritoneum: no peritoneal nodularity

IMPRESSION:
