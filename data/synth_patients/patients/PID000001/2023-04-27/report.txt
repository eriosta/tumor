FINDINGS:
Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
Comparison: 2023-03-07.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. Post-treatment change: consolidation conforming to beam path. Post-treatment change: fat stranding.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. aorta normal caliber.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. hemangioma (peripheral nodular enhancement with centripetal fill-in). no hepatic mass.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. spleen normal size.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. side-branch IPMN (no worrisome features). serous cystadenoma.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. adrenal glands normal.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. no renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. no bowel obstruction.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking. no peritoneal nodularity.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: 2.6 cm spiculated mass within the prostate gland, peripheral zone. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Prostate primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at prostate gland, peripheral zone measuring approximately 26 mm.
- No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=1; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 48→26 mm (longest diameter).
- SLD baseline: 48 mm.
- SLD current: 26 mm (-45.8% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.

Comment: Some features are could reflect; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
