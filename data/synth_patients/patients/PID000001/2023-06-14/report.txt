EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous <=5-mm axial images. Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
HISTORY: Staging/restaging of solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Pulmonary parenchyma: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: 27 mm spiculated mass within the prostate gland, peripheral zone. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 2023-04-27, interval evaluation as below.
INCIDENTAL / OTHER FINDINGS:
- kidneys: angiomyolipoma (macroscopic fat)
- pancreas: side-branch IPMN (no worrisome features)
- lung: subpleural reticulation
- pancreas: side-branch IPMN (no worrisome features)
- bladder: under-distension wall thickening

NEGATIVE FINDINGS:
- gi: stomach is normal
- kidneys: no renal mass
- pancreas: pancreas is normal
- bones: no destructive osseous lesion
- reproductive: ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality
- spleen: spleen normal size
- lung: no suspicious pulmonary nodule

IMPRESSION:
- Prostate primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at prostate gland, peripheral zone measuring approximately 27 mm.
- No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=1; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 48→27 mm (longest diameter).
- SLD baseline: 48 mm.
- SLD current: 27 mm (-43.8% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.

Comment: Some features are indeterminate for; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
