Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. simple cyst. liver is normal.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. tiny cyst. spleen normal size.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. no pancreatic mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
