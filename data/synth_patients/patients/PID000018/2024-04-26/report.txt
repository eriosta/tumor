FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2024-02-22.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. Post-treatment change: fat stranding.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 33 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. no pleural nodularity.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. aorta normal caliber.
Liver: 14 mm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. spleen normal size.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 15 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. adrenal glands normal.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. no renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 48 mm lobulated mass involving the sigmoid colon with focal wall thickening (isoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. simple physiologic cyst.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:

  • T4: Lymph node — 26→33 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 88 mm.
- SLD current: 110 mm (+25.0% change).
- New lesions: present (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.
