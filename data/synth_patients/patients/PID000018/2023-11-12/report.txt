IMPRESSION:
- Colon primary malignancy at sigmoid colon measuring approximately 38 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal, liver.

  • T2: Metastasis — 12 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T3: Metastasis — 12 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T4: Lymph node — 26 mm (short axis) at baseline.
- SLD baseline: 88 mm.
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: Baseline (no category).
