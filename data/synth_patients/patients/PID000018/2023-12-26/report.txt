FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-11-12.
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 2.5 cm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no mediastinal mass.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. tortuosity.
Liver: 11 mm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. no hepatic mass.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. spleen normal size.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 1.0 cm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 34 mm lobulated mass involving the sigmoid colon with focal wall thickening (isoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. physiologic under-distension thickening. no colonic mass.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. degenerative changes.

IMPRESSION:
- Colon primary malignancy at sigmoid colon measuring approximately 34 mm.

  • T3: Metastasis — 12→11 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 26→25 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 88 mm.
- SLD current: 80 mm (-9.1% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
