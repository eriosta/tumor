FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-12-26.
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 32 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. prominent but subthreshold lymph nodes.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 1.5 cm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. spleen normal size.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. pancreas is normal.
Adrenal glands: 15 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. Bosniak I cyst.
GI tract/Bowel: 48 mm lobulated mass involving the sigmoid colon with focal wall thickening (isoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. no bowel obstruction.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Colon primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at sigmoid colon measuring approximately 48 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal, liver.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=4; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 38→48 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 12→15 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 12→15 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 26→32 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 88 mm.
- SLD current: 110 mm (+25.0% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.

Comment: Some features are indeterminate for; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
