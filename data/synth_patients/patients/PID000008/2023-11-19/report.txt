FINDINGS:
Partial volume averaging may obscure small foci.
Comparison: 2023-10-06.
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax. no pleural effusion.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. pancreas is normal.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. kidneys are normal.
GI tract/Bowel: 30 mm lobulated mass involving the transverse colon with focal wall thickening (hyperenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. diverticulosis.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. calcifications.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node, short axis 19 mm. Enlarged inguinal lymph node, short axis 2.4 cm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Colon primary malignancy at transverse colon measuring approximately 30 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.

  • T2: Lymph node — 16→19 mm (short axis).
  • T3: Lymph node — 22→24 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 65 mm.
- SLD current: 73 mm (+12.3% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.
