Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. aorta normal caliber.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. no adrenal nodule.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 1.8 cm lobulated mass involving the transverse colon with focal wall thickening (hyperenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
