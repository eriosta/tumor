Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. mild aortic atherosclerosis. no aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. liver is normal.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: 2.3 cm lobulated enhancing renal mass in the left kidney, interpolar. No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
