FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Comparison: 2023-05-06.
Pulmonary parenchyma: 5.3 cm spiculated mass in the left middle lobe (hyperenhancing). Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged right hilar lymph node, short axis 16 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. spleen normal size.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. no adrenal nodule.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. prostate is normal / no prostatic mass.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged porta hepatis lymph node, short axis 14 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Lung primary malignancy at left middle lobe measuring approximately 53 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 61→53 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 17→16 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 78 mm.
- SLD current: 69 mm (-11.5% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
