FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-07-12.
Pulmonary parenchyma: 66 mm spiculated mass in the left middle lobe (hyperenhancing). No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Enlarged right hilar lymph node, short axis 18 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. prominent but subthreshold lymph nodes.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. no aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. Post-ablation/embolization change: non-enhancing ablation cavity with peripheral rim; SBRT field with altered enhancement.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged porta hepatis lymph node, short axis 14 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Lung primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at left middle lobe measuring approximately 66 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 61→66 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 17→18 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 78 mm.
- SLD current: 84 mm (+7.7% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.

Comment: Some features are unlikely; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
