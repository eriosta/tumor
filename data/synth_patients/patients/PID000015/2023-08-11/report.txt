FINDINGS:
Lungs: 74 mm smooth mass in the right middle lobe (isoenhancing). No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax. no pleural effusion.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 1.8 cm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. no pleural nodularity.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. aorta normal caliber.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 25 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. Bosniak I cyst.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. nonspecific fluid levels. no bowel obstruction.
Mesentery/Omentum: 9 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Lung primary malignancy at right middle lobe measuring approximately 74 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 74 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T2: Metastasis — 25 mm (longest diameter) at baseline.
  • T3: Lymph node — 18 mm (short axis) at baseline.
- SLD baseline: 117 mm.
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: Baseline (no category).
