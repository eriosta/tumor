FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2023-10-11.
Lungs: 104 mm smooth mass in the right middle lobe (isoenhancing). Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. no pleural effusion.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 24 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. mild aortic atherosclerosis.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 35 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. kidneys are normal.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. stomach is normal.
Mesentery/Omentum: 0.9 cm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. urinary bladder normal.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Lung primary malignancy at right middle lobe measuring approximately 104 mm.

  • T2: Metastasis — 25→35 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 18→24 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 117 mm.
- SLD current: 163 mm (+39.3% change).
- New lesions: present (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.
