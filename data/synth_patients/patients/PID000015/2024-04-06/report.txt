FINDINGS:
Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
Comparison: 2024-02-02.
Lungs: 102 mm smooth mass in the right middle lobe (isoenhancing). No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax. dependent atelectasis. subpleural reticulation.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 23 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. no aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. liver is normal.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 3.3 cm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: 9 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. urinary bladder normal.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
