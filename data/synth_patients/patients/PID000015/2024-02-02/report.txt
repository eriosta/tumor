FINDINGS:
Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
Comparison: 2023-12-13.
Lungs: 94 mm smooth mass in the right middle lobe (isoenhancing). Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. Post-treatment change: stricture formation.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 24 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no mediastinal mass.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 32 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified. small benign polyp.
Mesentery/Omentum: 9 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking. no peritoneal nodularity.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. under-distension wall thickening. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. no destructive osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
- Lung primary malignancy at right middle lobe measuring approximately 94 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 74→94 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 25→32 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 18→24 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 117 mm.
- SLD current: 150 mm (+28.2% change).
- New lesions: present (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.
