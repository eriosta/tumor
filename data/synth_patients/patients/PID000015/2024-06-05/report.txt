FINDINGS:
Respiratory motion artifact partially limits assessment.
Comparison: 2024-04-06.
Pulmonary parenchyma: 100 mm smooth mass in the right middle lobe (isoenhancing). Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 25 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. no aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. spleen normal size.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass. simple cyst (<2 cm). no pancreatic mass.
Adrenal glands: 3.4 cm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. adrenal glands normal.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: 0.9 cm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable. no focal bladder wall thickening.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture. bone islands.

IMPRESSION:
- Lung primary malignancy at right middle lobe measuring approximately 100 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 74→100 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 25→34 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 18→25 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 117 mm.
- SLD current: 159 mm (+35.9% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.
