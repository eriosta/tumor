FINDINGS:
Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
Comparison: 2023-08-11.
Pulmonary parenchyma: 77 mm smooth mass in the right middle lobe (isoenhancing). Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 18 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits. no mediastinal mass.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. aorta normal caliber.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation. no hepatic mass. Post-ablation/embolization change: non-enhancing ablation cavity with peripheral rim; SBRT field with altered enhancement.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. tiny cyst.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 26 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules. adrenal glands normal.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: 9 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. prostate is normal / no prostatic mass.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Lung primary malignancy at right middle lobe measuring approximately 77 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 74→77 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 25→26 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 18→18 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 117 mm.
- SLD current: 121 mm (+3.4% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
