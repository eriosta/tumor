FINDINGS:
Beam-hardening streak artifact from dense structures limits evaluation.
Comparison: 2023-09-08.
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified. no suspicious pulmonary nodule.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening. no pleural nodularity.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion. tiny cyst.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass. no renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: 11.0 cm smooth mass within the prostate gland, peripheral zone. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age. ovaries are normal / no adnexal abnormality.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged celiac lymph node, short axis 24 mm. Enlarged obturator lymph node, short axis 10 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Prostate primary neoplasm (indeterminate) at prostate gland, peripheral zone measuring approximately 110 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 79→110 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 18→24 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 97 mm.
- SLD current: 134 mm (+38.1% change).
- New lesions: present (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.

Comment: Some features are favored to represent; short-interval follow-up or problem-solving imaging may be considered.
