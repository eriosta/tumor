EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Pulmonary parenchyma: 26 mm lobulated mass in the right upper lobe (hypoenhancing). Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 9 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: 38 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node, short axis 9 mm with central necrosis. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: 34 mm lesion in the bone, suspicious for metastasis. No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 02/11/2020, primary mass new.

IMPRESSION:
- Lung primary malignancy at right upper lobe measuring approximately 26 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 26→16 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 34→22 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 38→24 mm (longest diameter).
- SLD baseline: 98 mm.
- SLD current: 62 mm (-36.7% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
