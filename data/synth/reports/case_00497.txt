EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged subcarinal lymph node, short axis 13 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 4.3 cm irregular hepatic mass in segment 4 of the liver (hyperenhancing). No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 26 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged porta hepatis lymph node, short axis 29 mm. Enlarged internal iliac lymph node, short axis 24 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 01/10/2023, primary mass smaller.

IMPRESSION:
- Liver primary malignancy at segment 4 of the liver measuring approximately 43 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:

  • T3: Lymph node — 29→38 mm (short axis).
  • T4: Lymph node — 24→31 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 122 mm.
- SLD current: 157 mm (+28.7% change).
- New lesions: present (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.
