EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT CAP with portal venous phase abdomen/pelvis; chest imaged in a single post-contrast phase.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 15 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: 80 mm irregular enhancing renal mass in the left kidney, lower pole. No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged mesenteric lymph node, short axis 2.7 cm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: Sclerotic osseous metastasis—nonmeasurable by RECIST (blastic). No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 08/06/2021, primary mass smaller.

IMPRESSION:
- Kidney primary malignancy at left kidney, lower pole measuring approximately 80 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone, lung.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=5; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 80→49 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 15→9 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 11→7 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 15→9 mm (short axis).
  • T5: Lymph node — 27→16 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 148 mm.
- SLD current: 90 mm (-39.2% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
