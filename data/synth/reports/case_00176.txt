EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 26 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 54 mm irregular mass involving the ascending colon with focal wall thickening (hyperenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged mesenteric lymph node, short axis 24 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: 31 mm lesion in the bone, suspicious for metastasis. Sclerotic osseous metastasis—nonmeasurable by RECIST (blastic). No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 07/28/2019, primary mass larger.

IMPRESSION:
- Colon primary malignancy at ascending colon measuring approximately 54 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=5; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 54→36 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 31→20 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 26→20 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 26→17 mm (short axis).
  • T5: Lymph node — 24→15 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 161 mm.
- SLD current: 105 mm (-34.8% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
