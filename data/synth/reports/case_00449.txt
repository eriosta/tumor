EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT CAP with portal venous phase abdomen/pelvis; chest imaged in a single post-contrast phase.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Enlarged subcarinal lymph node, short axis 29 mm with central necrosis. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 0.8 cm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: 5.1 cm complex adnexal mass in the right adnexa. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: 23 mm lesion in the bone, suspicious for metastasis. No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Ovary primary malignancy at right adnexa measuring approximately 51 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone, liver.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 51→32 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 23→14 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 29→19 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 103 mm.
- SLD current: 65 mm (-36.9% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
