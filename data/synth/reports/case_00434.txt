EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: 3.0 cm smooth mass in the left lower lobe (hypoenhancing). Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 20 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 26 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. 30 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged porta hepatis lymph node, short axis 22 mm. Enlarged obturator lymph node, short axis 15 mm with central necrosis. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 12/25/2019, primary mass new.

IMPRESSION:
- Lung primary neoplasm (possible) at left lower lobe measuring approximately 30 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=5; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 30→17 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 26→16 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 30→16 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 20→11 mm (short axis).
  • T5: Lymph node — 22→13 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 128 mm.
- SLD current: 75 mm (-41.4% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
