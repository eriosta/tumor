EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Pulmonary parenchyma: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: 4.6 cm smooth enhancing renal mass in the right kidney, lower pole. No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged porta hepatis lymph node, short axis 2.6 cm with central necrosis. Enlarged external iliac lymph node, short axis 30 mm with central necrosis. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Kidney primary malignancy at right kidney, lower pole measuring approximately 46 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: lung.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=4; ≤2 per organ rule applied).

  • T2: Metastasis — 14→9 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Lymph node — 26→16 mm (short axis).
  • T4: Lymph node — 30→18 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 116 mm.
- SLD current: 71 mm (-38.8% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
