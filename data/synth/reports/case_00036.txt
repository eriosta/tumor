EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: 42 mm spiculated enhancing renal mass in the right kidney, upper pole. No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged porta hepatis lymph node, short axis 13 mm. Enlarged internal iliac lymph node, short axis 26 mm with central necrosis. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 04/19/2025, primary mass new.

IMPRESSION:
- Kidney primary malignancy at right kidney, upper pole measuring approximately 42 mm.

  • T1: Primary — 42→26 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 26→17 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 68 mm.
- SLD current: 43 mm (-36.8% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
