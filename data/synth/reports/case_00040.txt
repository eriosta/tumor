EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 1.6 cm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: 60 mm complex adnexal mass in the right adnexa. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged external iliac lymph node, short axis 29 mm with central necrosis. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: 14 mm lesion in the bone, suspicious for metastasis. No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 07/06/2022, primary mass stable.

IMPRESSION:
- Ovary primary malignancy at right adnexa measuring approximately 60 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone, liver.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=4; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 60→36 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 16→10 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 14→9 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 29→17 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 119 mm.
- SLD current: 72 mm (-39.5% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
