EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT CAP with portal venous phase abdomen/pelvis; chest imaged in a single post-contrast phase.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: 73 mm lobulated pancreatic mass in the body of the pancreas (isoenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 2.2 cm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged mesenteric lymph node, short axis 12 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Pancreas primary neoplasm (probable) at body of the pancreas measuring approximately 73 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=2; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 73→39 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 22→12 mm (longest diameter).
- SLD baseline: 95 mm.
- SLD current: 51 mm (-46.3% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
