EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT CAP with portal venous phase abdomen/pelvis; chest imaged in a single post-contrast phase.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: 8.0 cm lobulated pancreatic mass in the head of the pancreas (hyperenhancing). Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 15 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: 26 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged porta hepatis lymph node, short axis 3.0 cm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 11/02/2021, primary mass stable.

IMPRESSION:
- Pancreas primary malignancy at head of the pancreas measuring approximately 80 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=4; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 80→56 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 15→10 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 26→17 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 30→20 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 151 mm.
- SLD current: 103 mm (-31.8% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
