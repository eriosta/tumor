EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT CAP with portal venous phase abdomen/pelvis; chest imaged in a single post-contrast phase.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 24 mm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 29 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 77 mm lobulated mass involving the descending colon with focal wall thickening (isoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node, short axis 21 mm with central necrosis. Enlarged external iliac lymph node, short axis 14 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 08/26/2024, primary mass smaller.

IMPRESSION:
- Colon primary malignancy at descending colon measuring approximately 77 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal, liver.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=4; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 77→98 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 29→38 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 24→30 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 21→26 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 151 mm.
- SLD current: 192 mm (+27.2% change).
- New lesions: present (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.
