EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Pulmonary parenchyma: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 15 mm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. 2.7 cm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 28 mm lobulated mass involving the descending colon with focal wall thickening (hypoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 01/22/2022, primary mass new.

IMPRESSION:

- SLD current: 41 mm (-41.4% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
