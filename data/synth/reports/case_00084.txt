EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT CAP with portal venous phase abdomen/pelvis; chest imaged in a single post-contrast phase.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Enlarged right hilar lymph node, short axis 18 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: 1.9 cm spiculated enhancing renal mass in the right kidney, upper pole. No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node, short axis 0.8 cm. Enlarged internal iliac lymph node, short axis 18 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: Sclerotic osseous metastasis—nonmeasurable by RECIST (blastic). No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 02/07/2023, primary mass larger.

IMPRESSION:
- Kidney primary malignancy at right kidney, upper pole measuring approximately 19 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone, lung.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=5; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 19→12 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 12→7 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 14→8 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 18→10 mm (short axis).
  • T5: Lymph node — 18→10 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 81 mm.
- SLD current: 47 mm (-42.0% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
