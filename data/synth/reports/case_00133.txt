EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT CAP with portal venous phase abdomen/pelvis; chest imaged in a single post-contrast phase.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 28 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: 63 mm smooth mass within the prostate gland, peripheral zone. No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged inguinal lymph node, short axis 1.2 cm with central necrosis. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Prostate primary malignancy at prostate gland, peripheral zone measuring approximately 63 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal, lung.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 63→66 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 28→30 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 35→37 mm (longest diameter).
- SLD baseline: 126 mm.
- SLD current: 133 mm (+5.6% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
