EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 55 mm smooth gastric mass at the lesser curvature of the stomach (isoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: 35 mm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged celiac lymph node, short axis 26 mm with central necrosis. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: Sclerotic osseous metastasis—nonmeasurable by RECIST (blastic). No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.

IMPRESSION:
- Stomach primary malignancy at lesser curvature of the stomach measuring approximately 55 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: bone, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=4; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 55→33 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 35→22 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 14→8 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 26→15 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 130 mm.
- SLD current: 78 mm (-40.0% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PR.
