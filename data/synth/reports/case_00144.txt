EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Pulmonary parenchyma: No focal consolidation or suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 9 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 5.3 cm lobulated hepatic mass in segment 7 of the liver (isoenhancing). No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged celiac lymph node, short axis 1.6 cm. Enlarged external iliac lymph node, short axis 28 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 10/12/2021, primary mass smaller.

IMPRESSION:
- Liver primary malignancy at segment 7 of the liver measuring approximately 53 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 53→58 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Lymph node — 16→17 mm (short axis).
  • T3: Lymph node — 28→32 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 97 mm.
- SLD current: 107 mm (+10.3% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
