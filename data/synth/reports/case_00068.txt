EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 18 mm spiculated gastric mass at the fundus of the stomach (hyperenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: 3.9 cm lesion in the peritoneum, suspicious for metastasis. Diffuse peritoneal thickening with nodularity and ascites, poorly defined—nonmeasurable by RECIST. No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 07/22/2024, primary mass larger.

IMPRESSION:
- Stomach primary malignancy at fundus of the stomach measuring approximately 18 mm.
- No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: lung, peritoneum.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 18→25 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 27→37 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 39→57 mm (longest diameter).
- SLD baseline: 84 mm.
- SLD current: 119 mm (+41.7% change).
- New lesions: present (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.
