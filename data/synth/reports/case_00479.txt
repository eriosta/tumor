EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed with IV contrast. Contiguous ≤5-mm axial images.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Lungs: 17 mm smooth mass in the right upper lobe (isoenhancing). Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged left hilar lymph node, short axis 18 mm. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: 2.5 cm lesion in the liver, suspicious for metastasis. No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 10/22/2021, primary mass larger.

IMPRESSION:
- Lung primary malignancy at right upper lobe measuring approximately 17 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: liver, lung.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=4; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 17→16 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 25→24 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 28→28 mm (longest diameter).
  • T4: Lymph node — 18→16 mm (short axis).
- SLD baseline: 88 mm.
- SLD current: 84 mm (-4.5% change).
- New lesions: absent (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: SD.
