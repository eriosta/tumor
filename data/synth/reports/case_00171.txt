EXAM: CT CAP
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT CAP with portal venous phase abdomen/pelvis; chest imaged in a single post-contrast phase.
HISTORY: Staging evaluation of known solid malignancy.

FINDINGS:
Pulmonary parenchyma: Clear lungs without focal mass. No suspicious nodules identified.
Mediastinum: Enlarged paratracheal lymph node, short axis 11 mm with central necrosis. Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
Great vessels/Aorta: No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
Liver: No focal hepatic lesions. Normal attenuation.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. No focal splenic lesion.
Pancreas: Normal pancreatic contour and enhancement. No focal mass.
Adrenal glands: 30 mm lesion in the adrenal, suspicious for metastasis. Adrenal glands are normal without nodules.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis. No enhancing renal mass.
GI tract/Bowel: 40 mm lobulated gastric mass at the antrum of the stomach (isoenhancing). No obstructive process. No focal bowel wall mass identified.
Mesentery/Omentum: No ascites. No omental caking.
Mesenteric vessels (SMA/SMV): SMA/SMV are patent without thrombosis.
Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.
Reproductive organs: No adnexal mass. Uterus/prostate within expected size for age.
Lymph nodes: Enlarged mesenteric lymph node, short axis 8 mm. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Bones/Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. No acute fracture.
Comparison: Compared to prior 06/19/2023, primary mass smaller.

IMPRESSION:
- Stomach primary malignancy at antrum of the stomach measuring approximately 40 mm.
- Findings concerning for nodal involvement.
- Findings compatible with distant metastases involving: adrenal, lung.
- RECIST 1.1 Summary:
- Target lesions (n=3; ≤2 per organ rule applied).
  • T1: Primary — 40→0 mm (longest diameter).
  • T2: Metastasis — 27→0 mm (longest diameter).
  • T3: Metastasis — 30→0 mm (longest diameter).
- SLD baseline: 97 mm.
- SLD current: 0 mm (-100.0% change).
- New lesions: present (unequivocal).
- - RECIST 1.1 overall response category: PD.
